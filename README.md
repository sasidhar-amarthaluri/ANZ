### Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains my workbook for both task 1 and task 2 of the ANZ Virtual Experience program.

ANZ is one of the big four banks in Australia. This virtual experience program aims to explore the transactional behaviour of ANZ customers by examining the transactions made by 100 ANZ customers over a 3-month period. These transactions include purchases, recurring transactions and salary transactions.
