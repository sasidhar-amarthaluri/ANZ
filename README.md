### Data@ANZ Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains my workbook for both task 1 and task 2 of the ANZ Virtual Experience program.

ANZ is one of the big four banks in Australia. This virtual experience program aims to explore the transactional behaviour of ANZ customers by examining the transactions made by 100 ANZ customers over a 3-month period. These transactions include purchases, recurring transactions and salary transactions.

# Task 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis [EDA] 

Load the dataset and extract distinctive insights which includes assessing the effect of any outliers and visualization of transaction volume.

Firstly, start by performing basic checks like looking out for any data issue's ? , whether data is clean or not ?

Gather interesting overall insights about the data. For example, what is the average transaction amount? How many transactions do customers make each month on average?

Divide the dataset by transaction date and time. Visualise transaction volume and spending over the course of an average day or week. Consider the effect of any outliers that may distort your analysis.

Final Step for Task : what insights can you draw from the location information provided in the dataset?

# Task 2 : Predictive Analytics
Inspect correlations between customer attributes, build a regression and a decision-tree prediction model based on findings.

Same dataset is used and need to identify nnual salary for each customer.

Find correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes. These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data or those that you construct or derive yourself. Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above.

How accurate is your model? Should ANZ use it to segment customers into income brackets for reporting purposes?

For Task:build a decision-tree based model to predict salary. Does it perform better? How would you accurately test the performance of this model?
